// =====================================================================
// LOADER ENTRY POINT                                     [NEOFORGE BODY]
// =====================================================================
//
// The ONLY class that knows what a mod entry point looks like on this loader.
// Everything it does is: register the keybind, register the /vmc command with
// this loader's command event, flush the buffered payload registrations, wire the
// config screen, and hand off to the shared VivemonkecraftClient.
//
// The Fabric branch replaces this file with a ClientModInitializer that does the
// same things through Fabric's events. Nothing else changes between branches.
//
// dist = Dist.CLIENT: this is a client-only mod (the Fabric branch says the same
// with "environment": "client"). It must still be able to CONNECT to servers that
// don't have it — see the optional-channel contract in VmcNet.
// =====================================================================
