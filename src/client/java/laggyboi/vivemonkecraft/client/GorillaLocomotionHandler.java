// =====================================================================
// GORILLA TAG LOCOMOTION HANDLER  (v5 — speed-based)
// =====================================================================
//
// Same spirit as the official Gorilla Tag (push/pull a surface, body moves the
// opposite way), but tuned for how VR + Vivecraft actually behave:
//
//   * Movement is driven by how FAST your hand is moving, not how far it is
//     pushed into a block. So a STILL hand = zero movement (you stay put, even
//     if the controller is resting in the ground), and only a real SWING moves
//     you. Gentle placement = nothing; a fast push = a launch. This is what fixes
//     the "it jumps when I set my controller down" problem.
//
//   * Per tick, for each hand touching a block:
//       swing  = how far your hand moved RELATIVE TO YOUR HEAD this tick
//       body velocity += -swing * pullStrength      (you go opposite your hand)
//     Measuring relative to the head means moving your body never feeds back into
//     the math — only your real arm motion counts.
//
//   * We SET velocity (not position) because Vivecraft drives the player position
//     from your headset and ignores direct position writes. Setting velocity to
//     the swing means: still hand -> ~0 velocity -> you hang/stay; moving hand ->
//     you move.
//
//   * The swing is measured on your RAW hand (true 1:1), while the longer "reach"
//     is only used to DETECT the grab — so reach doesn't make motion twitchy.
//
//   * We average recent swing speed; when you LET GO above velocityLimit we fling
//     you (velocity = average * jumpMultiplier, capped). That's the jump.
// =====================================================================

        //               on the ground / fail to mantle 1-block steps.
